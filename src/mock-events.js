        "<p>Hey Coders,</p> <p>This month's tech talk is brought to you by HEB. We will have two speakers from HEB.</p> <p>Molly King: Testing Android Retrofit code with RxJava2<br/>RxJava allows us to write clean, easy to read networking code using the Retrofit library. But how do we write unit tests for it? This talk will introduce some basic networking using RxJava and demonstrate how to write comprehensive unit tests for it, all in Kotlin!</p> <p>Beth Gilomen: Itâ€™s options all the way down<br/>Using recursive react components to render a nested menu options component</p>",
